# Streem Web Code Challenge

Welcome to Streem's Web Code challenge. We have made a react application for you to start with. This challenge will have you create a grid system to display grid items well.

If you finish this challenge, great! If you don't, take notes because we want to hear your thought process. 


## Challenge 

In this challenge, you need to display `n` divs in a grid with the following acceptance criteria:

* There can be `n` items in the grid.
* Each grid item must maintain a 16/9 aspect ratio.
* The grid should reorganize and resize items into the *best* amount of columns and rows. *Best* is defined as the largest possible item is displayed and each item is the same size.
* [The only code you can modify are the contents of **`getGridItemDimensions`** in the file `Result.tsx`. This function must return the `Dimensions` for a grid item](https://github.com/streem/web-code-challenge/blob/master/src/components/Result.tsx#L125-L146)
