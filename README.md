# Streem Web Code Challenge

Welcome to Streem's Web Code challenge. This challenge will have you determining the dimensions of items in a grid dynamically so they are laid out nicely in their parent container. We have made a React application for you to start with so you can focus on the sizing and layout specifics.

## Before you begin...

Please read through this README carefully. If you have any questions, please ask. Lastly, **the point of this challenge is to do it, not necessarily to finish it**. If you finish it, that's awesome! If you don't, take notes because we want to hear about your challenges and your thought process while working through it.

## Challenge 

We want to display `n` divs in a grid such that the grid reorganizes itself and resizes items into the *best* number of columns and rows. When working, it should look and act similar to this:

### Requirements

* The grid can accommodate `n` items.
* Each grid item must maintain a 16/9 aspect ratio.
* The grid should reorganize and resize items into the *best* amount of columns and rows. *Best* is defined as the largest possible item is displayed and each item is the same size.
* The only code you should modify is the [`getGridItemDimensions` function in the file `Result.tsx`](https://github.com/streem/web-code-challenge/blob/master/src/components/Result.tsx#L125-L146). This function must return the `Dimensions` for a grid item.

While creating your solution, please follow these rules: 

* No new dependencies please. 
* Try to limit yourself to 3 hours maximum for working on it.  This limit is for your scheduleâ€™s benefit. Again: if you complete the challenge, thatâ€™s good. If you donâ€™t, thatâ€™s ok, too!
* You have 1 week to work on the challenge. We understand you may have work, family, or other commitments and want to give you plenty of space to do the challenge alongside those.
